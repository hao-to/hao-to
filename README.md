## Aloha, I'm Hao, hao ya doin'? ðŸ‘‹
I know how to write 'how', but just so you know how to say my name ðŸ˜‰.

### About Me:
Languages have always been my thing â€“ whether it's speaking them, cooking up cultural recipes, or crafting puns. So I thought, why not try my hand at learning a language spoken by an exclusive club of very unique individuals (aka programmers). Turns out, this club is exclusive for a reason â€“ the language is... letâ€™s say, very specialized. And Iâ€™m still working on becoming a full-fledged member... someday! ðŸ˜…
### Currently
I'm deeply immersed in a software engineering bootcamp, learning to write clean code and exploring topics like web development, databases, and API integration. At the same time, I'm in training to become a systemic-integrative coach â€“ one of my creative approaches (or crazy ideas ðŸ¤”?!) to combining soft skills with technical abilities. Just like in any perfect recipe â€“ whether for work, relationships, or life in general â€“ the right ingredients make all the difference. In this case, a balanced mix of soft and hard skills is essential.
### New to Tech
I'm new to the tech world and GitHub, so thanks for your patience as I learn and grow. I'm on a journey to build my skills and am excited to see where I'll be in the near future! ðŸ˜Š

### Fun Facts
I love creating international and Asian-inspired dishes â€“ cooking is my way of bringing a bit of the world to my table.
Connecting with people from different backgrounds is something I truly enjoy, and I believe that both tech and personal skills play a part in building those connections.
